# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on to sharpen my skills. Most of these projects are based on tutorials from YouTube, but I have made modifications and improvements to better understand the concepts.

## Table of Contents

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
### Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: This project involves building a sentiment analysis model to classify YouTube comments as positive, negative, or neutral. I used **RandomForestClassifier** for this classification task, as it offers a strong performance for text classification problems.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, RandomForestClassifier
- **Key Features**:
  - Preprocessing text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
  - Vectorizing text using TF-IDF
  - Training the RandomForestClassifier
  - Evaluating the model with precision, recall, and F1-score
